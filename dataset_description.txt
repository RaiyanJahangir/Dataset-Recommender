The EMBED dataset (Emory BrEast imaging Dataset) comprises 3,383,659 screening and diagnostic mammogram images from 115,910 patients. Of these, 20% of the 2D and C-view images are available for research use, which includes 480,606 DICOM images, 676,009 PNG images, and 34,004 spot magnified images. Additionally, the dataset contains four files of clinical data and metadata. This dataset is useful for various applications, including breast cancer detection, breast cancer risk prediction, mammographic report generation, breast cancer type classification, tumor localization, and breast density estimation, among others. The data is available upon signing an agreement and can be accessed through AWS Marketplace. An associated article, The EMory BrEast imaging Dataset (EMBED): A Racially Diverse, Granular Dataset of 3.4 Million Screening and Diagnostic Mammographic Images, was published in 2023 and can be found here. The dataset contains mammogram images, clinical data, and metadata in DICOM format and was collected from the USA.

The DREAM dataset (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) consists of 144,231 screening mammograms from 85,580 women in the United States and 166,578 screening mammograms from 68,008 women in Sweden. It is primarily used for breast cancer detection and breast tumor classification. However, the dataset is not publicly accessible. Metadata is available at Synapse. An associated article, Evaluation of Combined Artificial Intelligence and Radiologist Assessment to Interpret Screening Mammograms, was published in 2020 and is accessible here. The dataset consists of mammogram images stored in CSV format and was collected from the USA and Sweden.

The DDSM dataset (Digital Database for Screening Mammography) contains 2,620 scanned film mammograms, including 339 images with abnormalities, 373 normal cases, and 223 cancer cases. It is primarily used for breast cancer detection and lesion localization. The dataset is publicly accessible at USF's website, and a mini version is available on Kaggle. The dataset was first published in 1998, and the associated article, Current Status of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography, can be found here. It contains mammogram images and metadata stored in ICS, overlay, and lossless JPEG formats, collected from the USA.

The CBIS-DDSM dataset (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography) is an updated version of the DDSM dataset. It contains 2,620 scanned film mammograms converted into DICOM format, resulting in a total of 10,239 images. This dataset is useful for breast cancer detection, breast tumor classification, image segmentation, mammographic report generation, multi-modal learning, and synthetic data generation. It is publicly accessible at The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The associated article, A curated mammography data set for use in computer-aided detection and diagnosis research, was published in 2017 and can be found here. The dataset consists of mammogram images and radiomic features in DICOM and CSV formats, collected from the USA.

The RBIS-DDSM dataset (Re-curated Breast Imaging Subset of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography) is an improved and standardized version of CBIS-DDSM, containing 849 mammogram images. Like its predecessor, it is useful for breast cancer detection, breast tumor classification, image segmentation, mammographic report generation, multi-modal learning, and synthetic data generation. The dataset is publicly accessible at IEEE DataPort. Unlike previous versions, it does not have an associated research paper. It contains mammogram images and radiomic features in DICOM and CSV formats, collected from the USA.
