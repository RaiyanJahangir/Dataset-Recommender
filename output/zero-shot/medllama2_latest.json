DMID has a more homogeneous population, with 94% Indian subjects.\n3) Granularity: EMBED is highly granular with 860 categories for BI-RADS assessment, while DMID uses a more straightforward classification of benign or malignant lesions.\n4) Data availability: Both datasets are available upon signing an agreement, but the EMBED dataset has an accessible version that can be accessed without an agreement. However, the DMID dataset only provides the original data and not the accessible version.\n5) Research scope: While both datasets can be used for breast cancer diagnosis research, EMBED also includes screening mammography images, while DMID focuses solely on diagnostic mammography.\n6) Metadata availability: Both datasets have metadata available to describe the characteristics of the images. However, EMBED's metadata is more detailed and includes additional information such as patient demographics.\n7) Data collection process: The data collection process for EMBED was more standardized, with a structured protocol for image acquisition and annotation. DMID's data collection process may be less standardized.\n8) Research community engagement: EMBED has been more widely adopted in the research community, with over 100 publications to date. DMID is still gaining popularity but already has several publications."
