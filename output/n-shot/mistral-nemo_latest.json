This might limit its applicability for tasks requiring large amounts of data, such as training deep learning models from scratch or evaluating model generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, it can be useful for initial explorations, comparisons with other methods, or as a small-scale validation set alongside larger datasets.\n\nLastly, make sure to cite the original source (Mammographic Image Analysis Society - MIAS database) when using this dataset to maintain transparency and credibility in your work."
