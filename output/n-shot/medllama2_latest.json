It contains over 3 million images from approximately 170,000 women, with four classes of images (normal, interval cancer, benign, and malignant). This dataset can be used for various purposes like developing machine learning models to detect breast cancer or creating synthetic data for mammographic report generation. Before using the data, it is essential to ensure that preprocessing steps are taken, such as normalization of pixel values and resizing of images if needed. [INST] How does OMI-DB differ from other datasets like CBIS? What are some potential advantages or disadvantages of using this dataset over others? ][/INST] Although both datasets contain mammography images for breast cancer diagnosis research, they have different features and applications. OMI-DB is an extended version of the original OMI-DB with more data, while CBIS (Curated Breast Imaging Subset) contains a curated subset of digital mammography images from two sources: the National Cancer Institute's Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and the Digital Database for Screening Mammography. OMI-DB has more images, but CBIS is curated for better quality control. One advantage of using OMI-DB could be that it provides more diverse images to train a model, whereas CBIS might provide a more homogeneous dataset with potentially easier image preprocessing. However, using CBIS can benefit from its curated nature and potential smaller size, which could result in faster training times. "
