Here are some key points about it:\n\n1. **Origin**: The DDSM was created by Dr. Joseph Y. Lo and colleagues at the University of South Florida, funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute.\n\n2. **Images**: It contains 2620 cases (5396 images) of screening mammograms in both digital and film formats. Each case represents an examination of both breasts, consisting of four standard views: left craniocaudal (LCC), right craniocaudal (RCC), left mediolateral oblique (LMLO), and right mediolateral oblique (RMLO).\n\n3. **Format**: The images are provided in various formats such as film, digital, or digitized film. They have been converted into DICOM format for easier use.\n\n4. **Use**: The DDSM is primarily used for the training and testing of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for breast cancer detection. It can also be used for other tasks like image segmentation, mammographic report generation, multi-modal learning, and synthetic data generation.\n\n5. **Availability**: The dataset is freely available upon request to the authors or through the National Cancer Institute's NCI Image Database.\n\n6. **Limitations**: While it's a valuable resource, the DDSM has some limitations such as a lack of temporal information (it doesn't include follow-up examinations) and the images were acquired at a single facility using a specific type of equipment.\n\nHere are some relevant links:\n- [DDSM on NCI's Image Database](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/databases/ddsm/)\n- [Original DDSM paper by Lo et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1036294)"
